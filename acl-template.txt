# This is a template access control (.acl) file which you can modify
# and then save in your Plume directory (next to index.html). This
# will allow public read access, and total control for you (as owner).
#
# IMPORTANT: take care or you can lose write access to the directory
#
# HOW TO USE:
# 1) Replace 'https://thewebalyst.solid.community/profile/card#me'
# with your WebID. This ensures you as owner have full control of
# the directory that contains the '.acl' file.
#
# 2) Copy the modifed file to a file called '.acl'
#
# 3) Upload '.acl' to the same directory as your Plume index.html file

# ACL resource for the public folder
